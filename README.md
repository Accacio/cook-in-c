
# [WIP] cook-in-c

Cooklang parser implemented in C

  
  

## Install:

Download the code as a zip file and extract, or use the git clone command to download:

```

git clone https://github.com/cooklang/cook-in-c.git

```

  

## Usage:

Cook-in-c can either be compiled as an executable to be run directly on linux systems, or it can be compiled as a shared library, which can then be used by other languages. There are more details about using the library in the _CONTRIBUTING.md_ file.

  

### Quick usage:
Install the following:
```
sudo apt-get install flex bison make gcc
```
  To compile the code as an executable use the command:

```
make parser
```
    

To compile the code as a shared library use the command:
```
make library
```
